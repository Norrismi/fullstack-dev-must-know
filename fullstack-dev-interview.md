#### EVENT DELEGATION:

When we have a lot of elements handled in a similar way, then instead of assigning a handler to each of 
them â€“ we put a single handler on their common ancestor.

#### CLOSURE:

A closure is an inner function that has access to the outer function's variables in addition to it's own 
variables and global variables. The inner function has access not only to the outer function's variables, 
but also to the outer function's parameters. You create a closure by adding a function inside another function. 

```
const data = "Beck";

const addNumbers = (a, b) => {
  let returnValue = "the result is: ";
  
  const add = () => {
    return data + ', ' + returnValue + (a + b);
  }
  return add();
}

const result = addNumbers(5, 10);

console.log(result) // Result is: 15


//*************************************

// const addNumbers = (a, b) => {
//   let returnValue = "Result is: ";
  
//   const add = () => {
//     return returnValue + (a + b);
//   }
//   return add;
// }

// const result = addNumbers(5, 10);
// const newFunc = result();

// console.log(newFunc)
```

#### VIRTUAL DOM:

Let's say that you have a list that contains ten items. You check off the first item. Most JavaScript 
frameworks would rebuild the entire list. That's ten times more work than necessary! Only one item changed, 
but the remaining nine get rebuilt exactly how they were before.

React's Virtual DOM solves this problem by updating only the parts where changes have been applied and leaves the rest 
of the items untouched. 

In React, for every DOM object, there is a corresponding "virtual DOM object." A virtual DOM object 
is a representation of a DOM object, like a lightweight copy. Manipulating the DOM is slow. Manipulating 
the virtual DOM is much faster, because nothing gets drawn onscreen. Think of manipulating the virtual 
DOM as editing a blueprint, as opposed to moving rooms in an actual house. When you render a JSX element, 
every single virtual DOM object gets updated.

This sounds incredibly inefficient, but the cost is insignificant because the virtual DOM can update so quickly.

Once the virtual DOM has updated, then React compares the virtual DOM with a virtual DOM snapshot 
that was taken right before the update.

By comparing the new virtual DOM with a pre-update version, React figures out exactly which virtual DOM 
objects have changed. This process is called "diffing".

Once React knows which virtual DOM objects have changed, then React updates those objects, and only those objects, 
on the real DOM. React would be smart enough to rebuild your one checked-off list-item, and leave the rest of your list alone.

This makes a big difference! React can update only the necessary parts of the DOM. React's reputation for performance comes largely from this innovation.

In summary, here's what happens when you try to update the DOM in React:

The entire virtual DOM gets updated.
- The virtual DOM gets compared to what it looked like before you updated it. React figures out which objects have changed.
- The changed objects, and the changed objects only, get updated on the real DOM.
- Changes on the real DOM cause the screen to change.
